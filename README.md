# Login-Page
design and develop a website with basic login page in PHP and MySQL. 

I have designed and developed a website with basic login page in PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and MySQL.
which takes input from user like full name, gender, username and password and store the information in backend server 
(here i have used xampp server to store the database).  
For front end designing I have created the login page with the help HTML and CSS (cascading style sheets). 
After that created a registration form in PHP and MySQL for users to register their details in the Database. Here 
if user puts the already existing data then it will be not allowed.

PHP is a open source server side scripting language which can be used along with HTML language to make the website more dynamic
and add more functionalities.
MySQL is a open source RDBMS.
